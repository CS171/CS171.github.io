CS 171 website
=============

This repository hosts the CS 171 websites - [http://www.cs171.org](http://www.cs171.org) - for 2014 and 2015. The 2014 version is completely contained in the 2014 subfolder, while the 2015 code is dynamically generated using the jekyll code hosted at the [2015-cs171-website repository](https://github.com/CS171/2015-cs171-website). See the respective folders/repository for deployment information.

The root directory contains an index.html file that automatically redirects to the latest instance (currently 2015).
