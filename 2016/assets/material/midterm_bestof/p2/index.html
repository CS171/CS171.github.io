                        <p>Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes.</p>
                        <p>People infected with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness at first.</p>
                        <p>Young children, pregnant women and non-immune travellers from malaria-free areas are particularly vulnerable to the disease when they become infected.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Left untreated, the disease can lead to severe complications and, in some cases, death.</p>

                        <h2>Transmission</h2>
                        <p>The disease is caused by five species of parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium, transmitted via the bite of female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles.</p>
                        <p>There are two modalities by which they are spread:</p>

                        <h3>Human-Human Transmission</h3>
                        <p>
                        P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale – are human malaria species that are spread from one person to another via the bite of female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. There are about 400 different species of Anopheles mosquitoes, but only 30 of these are vectors of major importance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most prevalent, and P. falciparum is the most dangerous, with the highest rates of complications and mortality. This deadly form of malaria is a serious public health concern in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

                        <h3>Zoonetic Transmission</h3>
                        <p>In recent years, human cases of malaria due to P. knowlesi have been recorded – this species causes malaria among monkeys in certain forested areas of South-East Asia.</p><p>Current information suggests that P. knowlesi malaria is not spread from person to person, but rather occurs in people when an Anopheles mosquito infected by a monkey then bites and infects humans (zoonotic transmission).</p>

            <h2>Moving forward</h2>
            <p>To address remaining challenges in global malaria control and elimination, WHO has developed the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030: it was adopted in May 2015. It sets ambitious goals for 2030:</p>

            <ul class="list-unstyled big-list">
                <li>Reducing case incidence by at least 90%</li>
                <li>Reducing mortality rates by at least 90%</li>
                <li>Eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries</li>
                <li>Preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To achieve these targets, annual funding for malaria will need to triple over the next 15-year period, from US$ 2.7 billion (current level of spending) to US$ 8.7 billion by 2030.</p>
