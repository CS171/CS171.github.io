# ![](i/seas.gif) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       CS 171 - Visualization | Syllabus

Welcome to CS171 Visualization! This course is an introduction to key design principles and techniques for visualizing data. The major goals of this course are to understand how visual representations can help in the analysis and understanding of complex data, how to use existing tools to make visualizations, and how to create your own interactive visualizations using modern web-based frameworks. 

This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Harvard General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. The course is also offered through the Harvard University Extension School as distance education course CSCI E-64. All lectures and labs will be recorded and the videos will be archived and streamed live during meeting times.

**After successful completion of this course, you will be able to...**

 * Critically evaluate visualizations and suggest improvements and refinements
 * Use JavaScript and other tools to scrape, clean, and process data
 * Use standalone visualization applications to quickly explore data
 * Apply a structured design process to create effective visualizations
 * Use principles of human perception and cognition in visualization design
 * Create web-based interactive visualizations using JavaScript and D3
 * Conceptualize ideas and interaction techniques using pen and paper 
 * Use storytelling principles to design coherent and clear visualizations

## Course Logistics

### Prerequisites

Students are expected to have programming experience (e.g., CS 50). Exceptions by permission of the instructor.

### Required Textbooks

We will be using two textbooks for this class, one to cover the theoretic aspects of visualization, one to teach us with the necessary technical skills. 


[Design for Information](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Information-Isabel-Meirelles/dp/1592538061), Isabel Meirelles, Rockport (2013)

![](i/design_for_information.jpg)
*“The visualization process doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it is grounded in principles and methodologies of design, cognition, perception, and human-computer-interaction that are combined to one’s personal knowledge and creative experiences. Design for Information critically examines other design solutions —current and historic— helping you gain a larger understanding of how to solve specific problems. This book is designed to help you foster the development of a repertoire of existing methods and concepts to help you overcome design problems.”*

[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray-ebook/dp/B00BSG68UQ), Scott Murray, O'Reilly (2013)

![](i/interactive_data_visualization.jpg)
*An introduction to D3 for people new to programming and web development, published by O’Reilly. “Explaining tricky technical topics with aplomb (and a little cheeky humor) is Scott Murray’s forte. If you want to dive into the world of dynamic visualization using web standards, even if you are new to programming, this book is the place to start.” - Mike Bostock, creator of D3*


### Recommended Textbooks

These recommended textbooks will allow you to deepen your understanding of specific aspects of the course, such as perception and storytelling.

[Visual Thinking for Design](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Thinking-Kaufmann-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123708966),  Colin Ware, Morgan Kaufman (2008)

![](i/visual_thinking.jpg)
*“All the clanking gears are here: variable resolution image detection, eye movements, environmental information statistics, bottom-up/top-down control structures, working memory, the nexus of meaning, and specialized brain areas and pathways. By the time he’s done, Ware has reconstructed cognitive psychology, perception, information visualization, and design into an integrated modern form. This book is scary good.” - Stuart Card, Senior Research Fellow, and manager of the User Interface Research group at the Palo Alto Research Center*

[The Functional Art: An introduction to information graphics and visualization.](http://www.amazon.com/The-Functional-Art-introduction-visualization/dp/0321834739/), Alberto Cairo, New Riders (2012)

![](i/functional_art.png)
*“If graphic designer Nigel Holmes and data visualizer Edward Tufte had a child, his name would be Alberto Cairo. In The Functional Art, accomplished graphics journalist Cairo injects the chaotic world of infographics with a mature, thoughtful, and scientifically grounded perspective that it sorely needs. With extraordinary grace and clarity, Cairo seamlessly unites infographic form and function in a design philosophy that should endure for generations.”
– Stephen Few, author of Show Me the Numbers*


### Online Discussion Forum
We use Piazza (www.piazza.com) as our online forum. Piazza is your main venue to ask questions, discuss problems, and help each other out. Piazza is a question-and-answer system designed to streamline class discussion outside of the classroom. It should always be your first recourse for seeking answers to your questions about the course, lecture or reading material, or the assignments. Piazza supports LaTeX, code formatting, embedding of images, and attaching of files. We will also use Piazza for all announcements, so it is important that you are signed up. 

### Online Videos
All lectures and labs will be broadcast live via Adobe Connect, including live video from the classroom, a synchronized view of the projected slides, and a chat window to ask questions and to contact fellow online students. In case the Adobe Connect server fails, you can also connect to an alternate live video feed. Both features will only work during class time. The archived videos of the lectures and labs are available about 24 hours after meeting time from the course homepage. 

### Office Hours
The staff will hold weekly office hours, either in person or online for distance education students. Office hour times and locations will be listed on Piazza. Office hours provide you with an opportunity to review and discuss course materials as well as provide further guidance for your homework in a more intimate environment, with only your teaching fellow and maybe a handful of classmates present. Online students can make special arrangements directly with teaching fellows to meet online.

## Course Components

### Lectures
The class meets twice a week for lectures and joint class activities. The class activities are designed to help you master the relevant materials, to work on your homework in groups, and to get you started on your project. The weekly schedule of lectures is posted on the course web site. 

### Labs
Lectures are supplemented by weekly 60- to 90-minute labs led by the teaching fellows or guest lecturers. Labs are an important aspect of the course, as we will supplement material from lectures with examples, discuss programming environments (e.g., JavaScript and D3), and teach you important skills (e.g., sketching with pen and paper). Lab topics are announced in the schedule. Labs will also give you the opportunity to work on your homework and your projects while TFs are present to answer your questions.

### Design Studios
Held during lecture times, the design studios are meant to hone your skills in designing visualization solutions, sketching and rapid, paper-based prototyping. At the beginning of each design studio you will be given a visualization problem. You then work on multiple solutions by yourself. After 30 minutes, you will form groups of 4-5 students and discuss and evaluate your respective designs. At the end of the design studio you hand in your best solutions and a critique of them as a group.

Online-only participants are encouraged to work in online-teams but are allowed to work individually. Online only students have to turn in the design studio exercise within 24 hours after its publication.

Attention: New!

### Projects
There is no question that the best way to learn how to create effective visualizations is by creating them. At the core of the course are two month-long iteration of one visualization projects. The goal of the projects is to design interactive visualizations that allow you to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualization method, implement the tool, and analyze the results. At the beginning of each iteration, you will receive a handout that describes the learning goals and evaluation criteria for that project. 

In your projects you will work closely with another classmate in a two-person project team. You can come up with your own teams and use Piazza to find prospective team members. If you can’t find a partner we will team you up randomly. We recognize that individual schedules, different time zones, preferences, and other constraints might limit your ability to work in a team. If this the case, ask us for permission to work alone. 

Attention: Two person team OK?

### Homework
The path to a good visualization design in your projects is likely to involve mistakes and wrong turns. It is therefore important to recognize that mistakes are valuable in finding the path to a solution, to broadly explore the design space, and to iterate designs to improve possible solutions. Bi-weekly homeworks are going to provide an opportunity to learn these design skills and to test your understanding of the material. The homeworks are designed to support you in developing the projects. You should be able to benefit immensely from synergies!

See the homework as an opportunity to learn, and not to “earn points”. The homework will also be graded to reflect this objective. If we can see that you put serious effort into solving a question but did not get it quite right during the individual phase, but got it right after the group reflection phase you will get full marks. 

### Reading Assignments
The course schedule includes required weekly readings – you are free to study ahead, but the schedule ensures that you are prepared for the activities in class and the homework. The goal of the reading assignments is to prepare for class, to familiarize yourself with new terminology and definitions, and to determine which part of the subject needs more attention. The homework assignments will contain questions about the mandatory readings. When answering those please be brief and to the point!


## Course Policies

### Assessment Procedure
Your final grade in CS171 will be determined by the number of points you collect. You can collect various amounts of points for the different parts of the class:

Projects: 50%, assessed on meeting the project criteria as described in the project handouts
Homework: 40%, assessed on your individual submission. 
Design Studios: 10% assessed on the quality of your design study solutions and reflections.

Best Projects: For each project iteration we will elect the top three submissions. In addition to a small price they will get 5 points for their exceptional work.

Attention: do we want to do best projects for the first iteration too?

Homework, projects, and participation will be graded on a 5 point scale in 0.5 increments using the following scale:

5 = Exceptional / above and beyond (we will only give out these for best projects)
4 = Solid / no mistakes (or really minor)
3 = Good / some mistakes
2 = Fair / some major conceptual errors
1 = Poor / did not finish
0 = Did not participate / did not hand in

A 4 constitutes a perfect grade, and getting all 4s is equivalent to an A. A combination of 4s and 3s end up being A- to B, and so on. An average of better than 2 is required to pass the course. Teaching Fellows will evaluate your work holistically beyond mechanical correctness and focus on the overall quality of the work. In addition to the scores the Teaching Fellows will give detailed written feedback.

Attention: new: average better than 2...

Keep in mind that your grade is also determined by your (genuine) effort, not only on correctness. There are several reasons for this approach. First, in design activities, risk-taking and wrong turns are a fact of life. Penalizing mistakes discourages risk-taking and creativity. Second, this approach allows you to control your effort better compared to trying to get open-ended problems right. Third, any anxiety associated with getting things right interferes with learning. If you enjoy this course, you will learn so much more!

### Project Group Peer Assessment
In the professional world, three important features affect your productivity and success: your own effort, the effort of people you depend on, and the way you work together. For this reason we have chosen a team-based approach that values all three of those features. After each team-based project you will provide an assessment of the contributions of the members of your team, including yourself. Your scores on the projects are adjusted up or down depending on the following factors:

 * Your teammates’ view of your contributions to the team
 * The accuracy of your own assessment of your contributions
 * The accuracy of your assessment of each of your teammates’ contributions

Your teammates’ assessment of your contributions and the accuracy of your self-assessment will be considered as part of your overall course evaluation.

### Collaboration Policy
Because teamwork is stressed in this class, collaboration, consulting information sources, and working with others is permitted. Please note the following restrictions, however. On the homework solutions you must list any help or hints you have received from others. Extensive collaboration (that is, solving the problem set with others) is not permitted. 

### Re-use of Work
You may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you provide or make available solutions to homeworks to individuals who take or may take this course in the future. 

### Questionnaires
During the course of the semester, you will complete a number of questionnaires online. The purpose of these questionnaires is to evaluate how well this course works for you. Your answers will only be used to provide feedback on your learning and make adjustments to the course. They will not affect your grade in any way. Unless stated otherwise, you may neither look up any information, nor consult others during these questionnaires.

### Quoting Sources 
You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. However, you are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise! 

You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using  proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and in any publicly visible material. You may not use existing complex combinations or large examples. For example, you may not use a ready to use multiple linked view visualization. You may use parts out of such examples. 

### Missed Activities and Assignment Deadlines 
Projects and homework must be turned in on time, with the exception of late days for homeworks as stated below. Because of the emphasis on teamwork, it is important that everybody attends and proactively participates in class and online. Due to the collaborative nature of the activities, it is not possible to make up any missed team activities, such as project work or design studios. (The same, incidentally, is true in the professional world.) We understand, however, that certain factors may occasionally interfere with your ability to participate or to hand in work on time. If that factor is an extenuating circumstance, we will ask you to provide documentation directly issued by the University, and we will try to work out an agreeable solution with you (and your team). 

### Homework Late Days
In the weeks when homeworks are due, they will be due on Thursdays at 11:59 pm, unless otherwise announced. Each student is given six late days for homework at the beginning of the semester. A late day extends the homework deadline by 24 hours without penalty. No more than two late days may be used on any one assignment. Assignments handed in more than 48 hours after the original deadline will not be graded. If you have already used all of your late days for the semester, we will deduct 1 point for assignments <24 hours late, and 2 points for assignments 24-48 hours late. **We do not accept any homeworks more than 48 hours after the original deadline.** Late days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason – no questions asked. You don't get any bonus points for not using your late days. Also, you can only use late days for the homework deadlines – **all other deadlines (e.g., project milestones) are hard**. 


### Regrading Policy
It is very important to us that all assignments are properly graded. If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please submit an explanation via email to us (the staff mailing list) within 7 days of receiving the grade. No regrade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 7 days after you receive the grade for the assignment.   

### Guest Lecture Attendance
We are lucky to have some of the world’s best visualization researchers take time out of their busy schedules to give guest lectures. We expect all non-distance students to attend these lectures and engage the speakers with questions and comments. You must send an email to the staff at least a day before a guest lecture to be excused.
