Welcome to CS171 Visualization! This course is an introduction to key design principles and techniques for visualizing data. The major goals of this course are to understand how visual representations can help in the analysis and understanding of complex data, how to use existing tools to make visualizations, and how to create your own interactive visualizations using modern web-based frameworks.
This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Harvard General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. The course is also offered through the Harvard University Extension School as distance education course CSCI E-64. All lectures and labs will be recorded and the videos will be archived and streamed live during meeting times.

## Course Goals
After successful completion of this course, you will be able to…
Critically evaluate visualizations and suggest improvements and refinements
Use Python and other tools to scrape, clean, and process data
Use standalone visualization applications to quickly explore data
Apply a structured design process to create effective visualizations
Use principles of human perception and cognition in visualization design
Create web-based interactive visualizations using Javascript and D3
Conceptualize ideas and interaction techniques using pen and paper
Use storytelling principles to design coherent and clear visualizations

Prerequisites
Students are expected to have programming experience (e.g., CS 50). Exceptions by permission of the instructor.
Required Textbook
Visual Thinking for Design,  Colin Ware, Morgan Kaufman (2008)
“All the clanking gears are here: variable resolution image detection, eye movements, environmental information statistics, bottom-up/top-down control structures, working memory, the nexus of meaning, and specialized brain areas and pathways. By the time he’s done, Ware has reconstructed cognitive psychology, perception, information visualization, and design into an integrated modern form. This book is scary good.” - Stuart Card, Senior Research Fellow, and manager of the User Interface Research group at the Palo Alto Research Center

### Online Discussion Forum
We'll be using Piazza (www.piazza.com) as our online forum. Piazza is your main venue to ask questions, discuss problems, and help each other out. Piazza is a question-and-answer system designed to streamline class discussion outside of the classroom. It should always be your first recourse for seeking answers to your questions about the course, lecture or reading material, or the assignments. Piazza supports LaTeX, code formatting, embedding of images, and attaching of files. We will also use Piazza for all announcements, so it is important that you are signed up. 

### Online Videos
All lectures and labs will be broadcast live via Adobe Connect, including live video from the classroom, a synchronized view of the projected slides, and a chat window to ask questions and to contact fellow online students. In case the Adobe Connect server fails, you can also connect to an alternate live video feed. Both features will only work during class time. The archived videos of the lectures and labs are available about 24 hours after meeting time from the course homepage.

### Office Hours
The staff will hold weekly office hours, either in person or via Skype for distance education students. Office hour times and locations will be listed on Piazza. Office hours provide you with an opportunity to review and discuss course materials as well as provide further guidance for your homework in a more intimate environment, with only your teaching fellow and maybe a handful of classmates present. Online students can make special arrangements directly with their assigned Teaching Fellows to meet on Skype.

## Course Components

### Lectures
The class meets twice a week for lectures and joint class activities. The class activities are designed to help you master the relevant materials, to work on your homework in groups, and to get you started on your project. The weekly schedule of lectures is posted on the course web site.

### Labs
Lectures are supplemented by weekly 60- to 90-minute labs led by the teaching fellows or guest lecturers. Labs are an important aspect of the course, as we will supplement material from lectures with examples, discuss programming environments (e.g., Python and D3), and teach you important skills (e.g., sketching with pen and paper). Lab topics are announced in the schedule. Labs will also give you the opportunity to work on the group aspects of your homework and your projects while TFs are present to answer your questions.
Projects
There is no question that the best way to learn how to create effective visualizations is by creating them. At the core of the course are three month-long visualization projects. The goal of the projects is to design interactive visualizations that allow you to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualization method, implement the tool, and analyze the results. At the beginning of each project, you will receive a handout that describes the learning goals and evaluation criteria for that project.
The first project is an individual effort. For the second and third projects you will work closely with another classmate in a two-person project team. You can come up with your own teams and use Piazza to find prospective team members. If you can’t find a partner we will team you up randomly. We recognize that individual schedules, different time zones, preferences, and other constraints might limit your ability to work in a team. If this the case, ask us for permission to work alone.
Homework
The path to a good visualization design in your projects is likely to involve mistakes and wrong turns. It is therefore important to recognize that mistakes are valuable in finding the path to a solution, to broadly explore the design space, and to iterate designs to improve possible solutions. Weekly homework (with the exception of weeks where projects are due) is going to provide an opportunity to learn these design skills and to test your understanding of the material. The homework is designed to support you in developing the projects. You should be able to benefit immensely from synergies!
Each homework involves two phases:
