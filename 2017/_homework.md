## Homework Rules & Hints
 
A couple of **important rules** to make our lives easier:
 
 * See the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/) for our [collaboration policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#collaboration-policy) and to learn how to [quote your sources]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#quoting-sources). 
 * We will be using state-of-the-art web technology. To avoid slowing us down with browser compatibility, we define a target platform, that we test against. Your code must be compatible with the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) - currently (Jan 2016).
