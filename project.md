Attention: The content on this page is subject to change.

You are expected to keep a process book detailing your steps in developing your solution, including, e.g., alternative designs you tried, describing the tools you used and what you did with them, etc.
We expect you to also (a) create a public website containing your visualization and describing it and (b) create a screencast demonstrating your visualization. Your web-based visualization can be implemented using any API or programming language you would like as long as it runs in modern browsers, but we will only support and answer questions regarding Python and D3 / Javascript.

## Submission Instructions

Submission will be handled trough github. If we cannot access your work or links because these directions are not followed correctly, we will not grade your work. In case of team projects you must use a single shared github repository.

### What to submit
**Code**: Including all libraries assuming they are not too big to include
**Data**: Include all the data that you used to do your project. If the data is too large for github store it on a cloud storage provider, such as Dropbox or Yousendit.
**README.md file**: You must include a README file giving a brief roadmap/overview of the organization of what you're handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites and presentation videos.
**Report**: Your Process Book in PDF format, including links to your online visualizations and project videos.


## Deliverables
### Proposal
We want you to start your project by forming your groups and letting us know what topic you may be interested in exploring by submitting a project proposal. Proposals will be due as part of the regular homework assignments. Your TF will give you feedback on the proposal after grading your homework.

## Process Book
An important part of your project is the report, which we call the process book. Your process book tells the story of your project from its beginning to the final design. Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your process book is the place you describe the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. It is not, however, a journal or lab notebook that describes every detail - you should think carefully about the important decisions you made and insights you gained and present your reasoning in a concise way.
We strongly advise you to include many figures in your process book, including photos of your sketches of potential designs, screen shots from different visualization tools you explored, inspirations of visualizations you found online, etc. Several images illustrating changes in your design or focus over time will be far more informative than text describing those changes. Instead, use text to describe the rationale behind the evolution of your project.
Your process book should include the following topics, however the specific format and content of the book is completely up to you. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of the following topics will vary:

 * Description of the data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.
 * Related work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, visualizations we discussed in class, etc.
 * Design evolution: What are the different visualizations you considered? Justify the design decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions? Provide clear and well-referenced images demonstrating the design evolution.
 * Visualizations: Describe the intent and functionality of your visualizations. Provide clear and well-referenced images showing key elements.
 * Analysis of data: What did you learn about the data by using your visualizations?
 
As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail make sure that your process book is a standalone document that fully describes your results and/or final design.

[Here are a few examples](https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B2Pu4bcI9HyOQWw2QnVWbU8zOVU) of process books from previous years. These are meant as inspiration and are not necessarily indicative of the scope for your specific visualization projects. Also notice that there was only one project in previous years instead of three.

## Code and Visualization
We expect you to write high-quality and readable code. You should strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reusability, error handling, etc. [Here](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html) are some guidelines on JavaScript code. We also expect you to document your code.

## Project Website
You will develop a web-based visualization. We expect you to include this visualization in a website which also briefly describes your project and embeds a demonstration video (see below). You are expected to submit this website including the visualization in your zip file. At a later date we will also ask you to upload the website to a webspace provided by us (details will follow). If you prefer to not publish your work please contact us.

## Project Presentation Video
Your presentation is important for conveying the key ideas of your project. For projects II and III, each team will create a two minute screencast with narration showing a demo of your application and/or some slides. Information about how to prepare these screencasts can be found [here](screencast.md), and some examples are here. Upload the video to an online video-platform such as YouTube or Vimeo and embed it into the same web page as your visualization and project description. We will show these videos in class.
We will strictly enforce the two minute time limit for the video, so please make sure you are not running longer. Focus the majority of your screencast on your main contributions rather than on technical details. What do you feel is the coolest part of your design? What insights did you gain? What is the single most important thing you would like to show the class? Make sure it is upfront and center rather than at the end. Also make sure that the sound quality of your video is good - it may be worthwhile to invest in an inexpensive USB microphone.
